       DESCRIPTION
           "This MIB module defines the IANAPwTypeTC and
           IANAPwPsnTypeTC textual conventions for use in PWE3
           MIB modules.

           Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB
           module require either publication of an RFC, Designated
           Expert Review as defined in RFC 2434, Guidelines for
           Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs, and should
           be based on the procedures defined in [RFC4446]. The
           Designated Expert will be selected by the IESG Area
           Director(s) of the internet Area.
